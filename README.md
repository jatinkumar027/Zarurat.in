# Welcome to Zarurat.in

Digital technology is changing the world in ways that would have been considered unimaginable a decade ago. The humble Kirana store, the dairy, or the medicine shops have proved extremely durable and digital-resistant.These stores have not only survived the supermarket or large format retail chains then, and e-commerce now, they are also thriving. A couple of factors keep them evergreen and relevant .Close to 12 million of these small stores dominates India’s grocery retailing and despite the stored expansion of organized, modern retail and the arrival of e-commerce, stores, and dairy are the lifeblood of Indian consumption with a 96 percent share of the grocery retail business. Another key reason the shop and dairy model will sustain itself is that real estate remains a huge challenge for supermarkets in India.

By modernizing the shops, dairy, and ensuring that business becomes better for them on the supply side and the consumer side, our website will be ensuring that both the customers and business owners benefit. There are ample technological solutions available to bring the unfancied shops and dairy into the mainstream of the e-commerce revolution, which sadly is restricted to a few big players right now.

Our website (**Zarurat.in**) will make a link between customers and Kirana stores, dairy and pharmacies, etc. Online medicine availability offers better factors than offline stores, with increased access, lower transaction, and product costs, convenience, and greater anonymity for consumers. They offer accessibility to people with limited mobility and people in remote areas. In this pandemic time, people ought to buy items through online mode and moreover, in today’s fast-paced world people are moving towards online purchases which results in all over economic growth. Our website is helping these stores to pursue the online mode and increase the purchase which will mark them as an individual in high rated market competition. Plus customers can purchase goods from shops at an affordable price which will lead to a high rated supermarket to cost cut the grocery items. Our website will not only lead to modernize the purchase but will also help in economic growth.

The solution is more digitization and hyper localization of mentioned shops with app payment and back-end integration of shops to ensure the customer’s unmet needs are met at the right time. This will remain the key differentiator and the reason why Kirana, dairy and medicine shops will continue to succeed.
